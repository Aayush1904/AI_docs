```
read:jira-work

read:issue:jira
read:project:jira
read:board:jira-agile
read:jira-user:jira
```

### Issue 3: Wrong Redirect URI

**Error**: "Invalid redirect URI"

   read:project:jira
   read:board:jira-agile
   read:jira-user:jira

   JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   JIRA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback?source=jira
   ```

### 5. Test the Integration

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/knowledge-integration`
3. Click "Connect" on JIRA
4. Complete the OAuth flow

2. Select your app
3. Go to "Authorization"
4. Verify all scopes are added
5. Verify redirect URIs are correct

### Check Your Environment Variables

```bash
# In your .env.local file
JIRA_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
JIRA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
JIRA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback?source=jira
```

### Test with Different JIRA Instance
